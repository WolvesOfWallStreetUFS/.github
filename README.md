Sure, here is a sample README file for a GitHub organization of computer science students looking to build and shape the future with elegant technologies:

# Wolfs of Wall Street

Wolfs of Wall Street is a small team of computer science students from the University of Free State in South Africa. We are passionate about using technology to build a better future.

We are currently working on a number of projects, including:

* A web app that helps students find and apply for internships
* A mobile app that helps students track their progress towards their academic goals
* A machine learning algorithm that can predict student success

We are always looking for new and innovative ways to use technology to make a positive impact on the world.

If you are a student who is passionate about technology, we encourage you to join our organization. We offer a supportive and collaborative environment where you can learn and grow as a developer.
